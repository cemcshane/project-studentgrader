<h1> CSE237 Final Project - StudentGrader </h1>


<h2> What user stories were completed in this iteration? </h2>
<p> For this iteration, we created a user story in which the user can delete assignments and categories to test possible grades or if they jut made a mistake. We also created a user story where the user can submit information from all of their classes to calculate their semester GPA. In these user stories the final grades now show up on the GUI instead of the console. We also created a user story where there's a pop up error when a user submits invalid input. Our last user story is that a user can now use a script to run the program instead of several commands.</p>

<h2> What user stories do you intend to complete in the next iteration? </h2>
None, the project is complete.

<h2> Is there anything you implemented but doesn't currently work?</h2>
Everything we implemented works and has been tested.
<h2> How to access our program:</h2>
<ol>
   <li> Clone the repository to your device via the command line. NOTE: If you're a Windows user, go to Start and type cmd into your search bar, then hit enter.  You will need to use this terminal.</li>
   <li>Via the command line, cd into project-studentgrader</li>
   <li>Run ./graderscript.sh via the command line (if you're on Windows cmd, run graderscript.sh instead if ./graderscript.sh doesn't work). This should open the GUI on your screen. Note: If you get a bash error pop-up when using Windows terminal, just ignore it and wait a few seconds for the GUI to pop up.</li>
   <li>Input the name of your classes, add a grading category, and input multiple assignments for various classes.</li>
   <li>Your final grade percentage and letter grade will displayed on the GUI and you can use them to calculate a semester GPA!</li>
