CSE237 Final Project - StudentGrader

1.  As a student I can input my assignments and grades and have them locally stored 

2. As a student I want to be able to get my overall grades in a course from my inputed grades on indivudual assignments
    As a student I want to be able to access my saved grades and not just store them as local variables
    As a student I want to be corrected with helpful messages when I incorrectly input information into the program
    
3. It doesn't properly store the assignments or print that out, but that's also not fully implemented

4. Clone the repository to your machine via the command line. 
   Open project-studentgrader folder 
   User will input class and grade information into input_file.txt (GradingProject > src > projectfiles)
   cd into the projectfiles folder. (cd GradingProject, cd src, cd projectfiles) via the command line
   java Parser.java input_file.txt (or use java Parser.java testfile.txt to test using our pre-inputed data)
