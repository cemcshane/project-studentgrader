1.  As a student I can input my assignments and grades and have them locally stored 
2. As a student I want to be able to get my overall grades in a course from my inputed grades on indivudual assignments
    As a student I want to be able to access my saved grades and not just store them as local variables
    As a student I want to be corrected with helpful messages when I incorrectly input information into the program
3. It doesn't properly store the assignments or print that out, but that's also ot fully implemented
4. User will input class and grade information into input_file.txt
   Clone the repository to your machine via the command line. 
   cd into the projectfiles folder. (cd GradingProject, cd src, cd projectfiles)
   java Parser.java input_file.txt
   If you don't want to make you own file you can use testfile.txt instead of input_file.txt
